Get started with Moondream in just a few minutes.
## Installation

~~~bash
pip install moondream==0.0.2
~~~

## Download Model

You can download the model directly from this link:
[Download Moondream 2B INT8 Model (1.7GB)](https://huggingface.co/vikhyatk/moondream2/resolve/1cf747d11539ba8827f172e57f2215b5df3306cd/moondream-2b-int8.bin.gz?download=true)

Place the downloaded model file in a `models` directory in your project folder. The final path should be `models/moondream-2b-int8.bin.gz`.

## Visual Question Answering

~~~python
from moondream import VL
model = VL("models/moondream-2b-int8.bin.gz")

answer = model.query(image, "What's in this image?")
print(answer['answer'])
~~~

That's it! You've just created your first VQA application with Moondream.
