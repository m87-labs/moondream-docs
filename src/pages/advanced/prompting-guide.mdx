This guide covers advanced prompting techniques to get the best results from Moondream while working within memory constraints.

## Core Principles

1. **Use Plural Nouns**: When asking about multiple objects, use plural nouns for better accuracy
   ```diff
   - "What is the object in this image?"
   + "What are the objects in this image?"
   ```

2. **Structured Output**: Request specific output formats to get more organized responses
   ```diff
   - "Describe this image"
   + "Provide two parts: 1. A brief caption 2. A comma-separated list of objects"
   ```

## Memory-Efficient Prompting

<Callout type="warning">
  Moondream operates in a memory-constrained environment. Each word in your prompt and the response counts towards token limits.
</Callout>

### Optimizing Token Usage

1. **Split Complex Queries**: Break down complex queries into simpler ones
   ```diff
   - "Give me a detailed description of the image, list all objects, and analyze the lighting"
   + Query 1: "Give me a brief description of this image"
   + Query 2: "List the main objects visible in this image"
   ```

2. **Use Semicolons for Multiple Outputs**
   ```python
   # Example prompt
   "Provide two concise answers separated by a semicolon: 1. A short caption describing this image; 2. A detailed comma-separated list of unique objects visible in the image, no general terms."
   
   # Example response
   "A Japan Airlines Boeing 747-400 with a red tail and blue and white logo; luggage carts, baggage trolleys, and a white van."
   ```

### Structured JSON Output

For programmatic use, request JSON-formatted responses:

```python
# Example prompt
"Give me a brief description of this image, and a detailed comma-separated list of unique objects visible in this image, no general terms. Output JSON with keys 'description' (string) and 'tags' (comma-separated string)."

# Example response
{
  "description": "Two Japan Air Boeing 747-400 aircraft are parked at an airport gate.",
  "tags": "airport, airplane, terminal, building, vehicle, luggage, ground crew"
}
```

## Best Practices

1. **Be Specific**: Request exactly what you need
   ```diff
   - "What do you see?"
   + "List the visible objects in this image, separated by commas"
   ```

2. **Avoid Complex Instructions**: Keep prompts simple and direct
   ```diff
   - "Analyze this image in detail, considering the composition, lighting, objects present, and potential symbolism while also noting any interesting patterns"
   + "List the main objects and their colors in this image"
   ```

3. **Use the `.encode_image()` Method**: For multiple queries on the same image
   ```python
   # Encode once, query multiple times
   encoded_image = model.encode_image(image)  # Caches preprocessing
   result1 = model.query(encoded_image, "What objects are visible?")
   result2 = model.query(encoded_image, "Describe the colors")
   ```

## Common Patterns

### Object Detection
```python
"List all unique objects visible in this image as a comma-separated list, no general terms."
```

### Scene Description
```python
"Provide a brief, one-sentence description of this scene."
```

### Detailed Analysis
```python
"Provide two parts: 1. A brief overview of the scene; 2. A detailed list of visible objects with their colors and positions."
```

<Callout>
  Remember that Moondream is optimized for concise, focused queries. If you need complex analysis, break it down into multiple simple queries.
</Callout>

## Examples

<Tabs items={['Basic Query', 'Structured Output', 'Multiple Queries']}>
  <Tabs.Tab>
```python
# Simple object detection
response = model.query(image, "What objects are visible in this image?")
```
  </Tabs.Tab>
  <Tabs.Tab>
```python
# JSON structured output
response = model.query(image, """
Give me a brief description and object list. 
Output as JSON with keys 'description' and 'objects'.
""")
```
  </Tabs.Tab>
  <Tabs.Tab>
```python
# Multiple efficient queries
encoded = model.encode_image(image)
objects = model.query(encoded, "List visible objects")
colors = model.query(encoded, "Describe main colors")
```
  </Tabs.Tab>
</Tabs>

## Troubleshooting

If you're getting unexpected results:

1. **Simplify Your Prompt**: Break down complex queries
2. **Be More Specific**: Use clear, direct language
3. **Check Token Usage**: Monitor response lengths
4. **Use Structured Formats**: Request specific output formats
5. **Cache Encoded Images**: Use `.encode_image()` for multiple queries
