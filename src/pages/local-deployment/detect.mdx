# Object Detection

Detect and locate objects in images with natural language using Moondream.

## Installation & Model

~~~bash filename="terminal"
pip install moondream
~~~

Download the model from our [Model Downloads](/model-downloads) page. While compressed models can be loaded directly, we recommend unzipping them first for faster loading times.

## Basic Usage

~~~python filename="example.py"
from moondream import vl
model = vl("models/moondream-2b-int8.bin") # Load unzipped model for faster startup

# Basic object detection
objects = model.query(image, "What objects do you see in this image?")
print(objects['answer'])

# Location-based detection
locations = model.query(image, "Where is the cat in this image?")
print(locations['answer'])
~~~

That's all you need to start detecting objects in images!
