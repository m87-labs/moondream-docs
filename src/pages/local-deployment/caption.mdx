# Image Captioning

Generate natural language descriptions of images with Moondream.

## Installation & Model

~~~bash filename="terminal"
pip install moondream
~~~

Download the model from our [Model Downloads](/model-downloads) page. While compressed models can be loaded directly, we recommend unzipping them first for faster loading times.

## Basic Usage

~~~python filename="example.py"
from moondream import vl

# Load unzipped model for faster startup
model = vl("models/moondream-0.5b-int8.bin")

caption = model.caption(image)
print(caption)
~~~

That's all you need to start generating image captions!
