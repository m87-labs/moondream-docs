# Visual Pointing

Get precise coordinate locations for objects in images using Moondream.

## Installation & Model

```bash filename="terminal"
pip install moondream==0.0.4
```

Download the model from our [Model Downloads](/model-downloads) page.

## Basic Usage

```python filename="example.py"
from moondream import vl
model = vl("models/moondream-2b-int8.bin.gz")

# Get coordinates of an object
coords = model.point(image, "point to the dog")
print(f"The dog is at coordinates: {coords}")

# Multiple points
coords = model.point(image, "point to all the windows")
print(f"Window coordinates: {coords}")
```

That's all you need to start using visual pointing!
