# Visual Pointing

Ask Moondream to locate specific objects or regions in images by returning their coordinates.

## Installation & Model

~~~bash filename="terminal"
pip install moondream
~~~

Download the model from our [Model Downloads](/model-downloads) page. While compressed models can be loaded directly, we recommend unzipping them first for faster loading times.

## Basic Usage

~~~python filename="example.py"
from moondream import vl

# Load unzipped model for faster startup
model = vl("models/moondream-2b-int8.bin")

# Get coordinates of an object
points = model.point(image, "the red car")
print(points)
# [
#   {
#     "x": 0.4,  # Normalized coordinates (0-1) 
#     "y": 0.6   # (0,0) is top-left, (1,1) is bottom-right
#   }
# ]
~~~

That's all you need to start locating objects in images!
