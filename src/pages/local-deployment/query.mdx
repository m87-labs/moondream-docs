# Visual Question Answering

Ask natural language questions about images and get detailed answers with Moondream.

## Installation & Model

~~~bash filename="terminal"
pip install moondream
~~~

Download the model from our [Model Downloads](/model-downloads) page. While compressed models can be loaded directly, we recommend unzipping them first for faster loading times.

## Basic Usage

~~~python filename="example.py"
from moondream import vl

# Load unzipped model for faster startup
model = vl("models/moondream-2b-int8.bin")

# Ask a simple question
answer = model.query(image, "What is the main color in this image?")
print(answer['answer'])

# Ask about objects
answer = model.query(image, "How many people are in this image?")
print(answer['answer'])
~~~

That's all you need to start asking questions about images!
