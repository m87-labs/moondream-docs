# Welcome to Moondream Documentation

Welcome to the official documentation for Moondream, a powerful vision-language model that enables you to analyze images, generate captions, and answer questions about visual content.

## What is Moondream?

Moondream is a lightweight yet powerful vision-language model that allows you to:
- üñºÔ∏è Generate detailed image descriptions
- üí¨ Answer questions about images
- üöÄ Run locally for privacy
- üéØ Support for CUDA acceleration
- üîÑ Stream responses for longer queries

## Quick Start

Get started by installing Moondream:

```bash
pip install moondream
```

Then use it in your Python code:

```python
from moondream import VL
from PIL import Image

# Initialize model
model = VL()  # Downloads model on first use

# Load and analyze an image
image = Image.open("image.jpg")
encoded_image = model.encode_image(image)

# Get image description
caption = model.caption(encoded_image)
print(caption["caption"])

# Ask questions about the image
answer = model.query(encoded_image, "What colors do you see?")
print(answer["answer"])
```
